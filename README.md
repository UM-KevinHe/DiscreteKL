# DiscreteKL: Kullback-Leibler-Based Discrete Failure Time Models

This package is for the paper "Kullback-Leibler-Based Discrete Failure Time Models for Integration of
Published Prediction Models with New Time-To-Event Dataset" by Di Wang, Wen Ye, Randall Sung, Hui Jiang, Jeremy M.G. Taylor, Lisa Ly, and Kevin He.

### Purpose

Prediction models built based on a single data source may suffer from rare event rates, small sample sizes, and low signal-to-noise ratios. Incorporating published prediction models from large-scale studies is expected to improve the performance of prognosis prediction. Thus, we propose Kullback-Leibler-based (KL) discrete failure time models to integrate published prediction models (external models) with an individual-level time-to-event dataset (internal data) while accoundting potential heterogeity among different information sources.
